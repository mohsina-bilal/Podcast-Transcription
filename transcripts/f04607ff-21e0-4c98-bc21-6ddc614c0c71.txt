The following is a conversation with Kimball Musk, a longtime entrepreneur and chef and author of a new cookbook called the Kitchen Cookbook Cooking for your community. You should check it out. It is, in fact the first cookbook I've ever owned. I've already made stuff from it and it's delicious. And now a quick few second mention of each sponsor. Check them out in the description. It is the best way to support this podcast. We got eight sleep for naps, expressVPN for security and privacy on interwebs, Netsuite for business, and betterhelp for mental health. Choose wisely, my friends. Also, if you want to work with our amazing team or just want to get in touch with me for a bunch of different reasons, please go to lexfriedman.com contact. Like the movie, except I'm not an alien. Allegedly. And now onto the full ad reads, as always, no ads in the middle. I try to make these interesting, but if you skip them, please still check out the sponsors. I enjoy their stuff. Maybe you will too. This episode is brought to you by power naps, the act of napping the act of sleep. But the act of napping, fundamentally, is where all of life's joys come from. Now, there's a lot of people disagreeing on this point. Anyway, it's eight sleep and they have a pot three cover that cools the bed down or heats it up. If you're an insane person, I love you too. Insane people are beautiful people. So we may disagree. Emacs versus vim, Messi versus Ronaldo. What else is there? I don't know. Those are the two big disagreements in my life. Although at this point, do you honestly disagree that Messi is the greatest of all time? Is there even a competition? I mean, you can appreciate the human, the genius of different players throughout the history of soccer, but Lionel Messi is just on another level. Anyway, at this very moment, I'm drifting downwards in terms of energy, and I just know that after this, I'll take a nap for maybe even ten minutes, maybe 15 minutes on the said eight sleep bed. It'd be cool, with a warm blanket, and when I get up, the birds will be chirping. There'll be butterflies in my mind. It'll just be all perfect. I'll sit down, maybe a little bit caffeine and just get back to work. Anyway, check it out and get special savings when you go to asleep slash flex. This episode is also brought to you by ExpressVPN, a thing I've used for many years to bring me joy. Speaking of said butterflies, it just brings me joy. What is life about? Really? Surround yourself with cool people. Surround yourself with products that make your life easier and products that fill your life with joy. It's perhaps ridiculous to say, but ExpressVPN has been with me for so many years that it's just like one of the thing in the cyber world I exist in. I spend so much time behind the computer. It's just a reliable thing I have across all operating systems. I have it on Linux, I have it on Windows, I have it on Android, and I don't use other operating systems often, but I do have an iPhone and I have it on that as well. Anyway, you can go to exprsvpn.com Lexpod for an extra three months free to check them out, to bring a little bit of joy into your life, but actually, more importantly, to have that basic layer of protection when you need it on the Internet and friends, you shall need it. This episode is also brought to you by Netsuite, an all in one cloud business management system. The kids these days, the cool ones, call it an ERP system. ERP is the brain at the center of the machine. A company is a machine that runs the machine, and at the meta level, the capitalist system is a machine of machines. So there's a lot of machines in there. Anytime I say the word machine, I think about Burt Kreischer. But I think he is probably not the kind of machine that would be efficient at running a large scale company. So he's a different kind of machine. He is indeed a machine, but a different kind. If you wanted a machine that's running your company and creating a sort of common language where the different modules of the company can communicate and just taking care of the messy stuff, the HR stuff, the managing financials, inventory, supply, ecommerce, all that kind of stuff, Netsuite is something you should check out. 37,000 companies have upgraded to Netsuite by Oracle.
